\titledquestion{Perfect Universe}[5]
  We consider a \textit{perfect universe}, $U$, that is inhabited by distinct elements. Any two elements, $a$ and $b$, can be \textit{combined} to yield a unique element $c$, denoted as $ab=c$. The following properties holds in $U$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Associativity: $\forall a\forall b\forall c [(ab)c = a(bc)]$. 
  \item \textit{Identity}: $\exists e\forall a (ea=ae=a)$. $e$ is called the \textit{identity} element of $U$.
  \item \textit{Enemies}: $\forall a\exists b (ab= ba = e)$. The element, $b$, that makes this property true for another element, $a$, is said to be the \textit{enemy} of $a$.
  \end{itemize}
  Note that commutativity need not hold, i.e., it is not necessary for all elements $a, b$ to have the property that $ab=ba$.

  Prove the following properties of $U$.
  \begin{parts}
  \item The identity element, $e$, is unique in $U$.
    \begin{solution}

      Using proof by contradiction.
      Supposing that the element is not unique.\\
      taking two elements e1 and e2 from the universal set.\\
      by definition, $e1a$= $ae1$=a\\
      $e2a$= $ae2$ = a \\
      both $e1$ and $e2$ yield the same result then it must be the case that $e1$ = $e2$\\
      this contradicts the assumption made in the  hence the e is indeed unique.
    \end{solution}
  \item Every element has a unique enemy.
    \begin{solution}
      
      Using Direct proof.\\
      Using the definition, $ab$ = $ba$ =$e$\\
      $ac$ = $ca$ =$e$\\
      Since $ab$ = $ba$ =$e$ and  $ac$ = $ca$ =$e$ both yield $e$, then $ab$ = $ba$ = $ac$ = $ca$ the enemy is unique.
      
    \end{solution}
  \item Given elements $a$ and $b$, the enemy of $ab$ is the same as the enemy of $b$ combined with the enemy of $a$.
    \begin{solution}
     
     Suppose c is the enemy of a and d is the enemy of b.\\
     Using direct proof.\\
     From the question we know that $ac$ = $bd$ = e\\
     Then Enemy of b combined with the enemy of a, $ab$ = dc\\
     To prove we need to show that $abcd$ is the same as $e$.\\
     $a(bd)c$\\
     $a(e)c$\\
     Using the identity, $ae$ = a, then   $a(e)c$ becomes $ac$\\
    From the question we know that $ac$ = e \\
    Hence proven that $dc$ is the enemy of ab and the enemy of b combined with the enemy of a.
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}
